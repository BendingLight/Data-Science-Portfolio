## Projets

### [Pneumonia Detection From Chest X-Rays Images](https://github.com/BendingLight/Pneumonia-Detection-From-Chest-X-Rays-Images)
* __EDA__ on the National Institute of Health chest x-ray [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) consists of 112,120 images of 30,805 patients.
* Cleaning and processing dataset by normalizing intensity, image augmentation, image resizing  with __Keras__.
* Training and fine tuning of neural network, application model architecture used __VVG16__ and __ResNet50__.
* Tried to implement the __CheXNet__ research paper.

### [Germanyâ€™s Electric Market Case Study](https://github.com/BendingLight/German-Electricity-Market-Study)
* Analyze and Forecast Electricity Market for the year 2020 in Germany using Recurrent Neural Network.
* Cleaning and processing large volumes of Germany's power generation and consumption data.
* Produced and presented relevant reports and visualizations.
* Dataset used Electricity Consumption, Electricity Generation, Installed Generation Capacity, Day Ahead Price of Gemany from [__SMARD__](https://www.smard.de/en/downloadcenter/download-market-data#!?downloadAttributes=%7B%22selectedCategory%22:false,%22selectedSubCategory%22:false,%22selectedRegion%22:false,%22from%22:1614898800000,%22to%22:1615935599999,%22selectedFileType%22:false%7D).

### [Number Detection With CNN In Keras](https://github.com/BendingLight/Number-Detection-With-CNN-In-Keras)
* I built the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digits recognition trained on [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset with keras API (Tensorflow backend).
* The project is very helpful to understand how CNN works at different layers.
* The current best score of this network is __0.9788__, but I will be pusing it to 0.99.

### [Gharelu Chat](https://github.com/BendingLight/Flutter-Gharelu_Chat)
* Cross-Platform mobile chat application for helping expecting mothers to keep them connected in emergencies.
* Active user __location tracker__, __SOS alert__ on __fall detection__, health checkup scheduler and medicine reminder.

### [Xylophone](https://github.com/BendingLight/Flutter-Xylophone)
* Cross-Platform mobile application simulating [Xylophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylophone).
* Plays saved music on pressing coloured tiles, you can play songs.
* It's actually the most amazing app that I have built, It's fun.

### [Cliam](https://github.com/BendingLight/Flutter-Clima)
* Exploratory project to display weather status with a dedicated emoji, Actually it was a 15 min challege from my brother.
* Getting device location across paltform and using [OpenWeatherMap - Current Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get climate Stauts.
